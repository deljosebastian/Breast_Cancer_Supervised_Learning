# Breast Cancer Supervised Learning Project

## Objective
Evaluate supervised learning techniques using the breast cancer dataset from the `sklearn` library.

## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` module contains features related to tumor measurements and a target variable indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Key Components
1. **Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it for analysis.
   - Handle missing values and scale features.

2. **Classification Algorithms**
   - Implement the following classifiers:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

3. **Model Comparison**
   - Compare the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- The comparison table and analysis of the best and worst-performing algorithms.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deljosebastian/Breast_Cancer_Supervised_Learning.git
